Module Review
1. What is the primary difference between blocking and nonblocking assignments?
▪ The blocking assignment operator blocks execution of subsequent statements until the assignment completes.
▪ The nonblocking assignment operator calculates the RHS expression and schedules an update to the LHS variable.
2. Where should you use blocking assignments?
▪ Use blocking assignments primarily in procedures that represent purely combinational logic.
3. Where should you use nonblocking assignments?
▪ Use nonblocking assignments for variables that represent storage, primarily in a procedure that represents sequential logic.
4. Where can you legitimately mix blocking and nonblocking assignments?
▪ You can make blocking assignments to intermediate (temporary) variables in a sequential procedure
